## Base Image for Atlassian Jira

Jira is a proprietary issue tracking product, developed by Atlassian. It provides bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management functions. Although often styled using all-capital letters as "JIRA", the product name is not an acronym, but a truncation of Gojira, the Japanese name for Godzilla, itself a reference to Jira's main competitor, Bugzilla. It has been developed since 2002. According to one ranking method, as of June 2017, Jira is the most popular issue management tool.
